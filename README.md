# HiveAid 2019 Graphics

HiveAid-bundle is a [NodeCG](http://github.com/nodecg/nodecg) bundle. It was developed and run in version 1.3.1. It may work with future versions, but there's no guarantee that it will work on anything else.

Big thanks to the GDQ and TipOfTheHats teams, the totals extension was taken from GDQ, and the omnibar is a straight up reskin of the TotH one.

## Features
- GDQ Donation tracker integration (total & popups)
- Countdown & break graphics
- Omnibar with "Up Next" & "On Now", as well as donation CTAs & total
